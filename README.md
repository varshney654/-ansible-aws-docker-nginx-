# 🚀 Ansible + AWS EC2 + Docker + Nginx Deployment

This project showcases a fully automated deployment pipeline using **AWS EC2**, **Docker**, and **Nginx** to serve a custom HTML landing page — all built and deployed by me 😎.

From spinning up the infrastructure to launching the application, everything was done using modern DevOps techniques and cloud-native tools.

## ⚙️ What I Did (Step-by-Step)

- ✅ Provisioned an EC2 instance on AWS  
- ✅ Configured Security Groups to open ports `22 (SSH)` and `80 (HTTP)`  
- ✅ SSH’d into the instance using a `.pem` key  
- ✅ Installed Docker to handle container deployment  
- ✅ Deployed an Nginx container that serves a beautiful custom `index.html` landing page  
- ✅ Verified deployment with a live public IP
